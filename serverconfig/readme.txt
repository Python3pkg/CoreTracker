This two files are my configuration in order to run CoreTracker.
1 ) You should edit your hosts file according to my example
2 ) Add a virtualhost in your apache configuration. For GNU-linux distro, the conf file directory is /etc/apache2/sites-available/. So add your coretracker.conf file inside (don't forget to modify it).
